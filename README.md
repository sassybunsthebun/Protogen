# Protogen
This is my repository for storing the code I am making for my protogen

# What you will need to recreate this 

 - 14x AdaFruit 1.2" 8x8 I2C matrix in whichever color you prefer. I used [these](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1052).
 - 1x Microcontroller with at least 2x I2C like STM32F407G-DISC1 (two sigle I2C-microcontrollers can be used as well, like an ESP32 or Arduino board)
 - Plenty of wires and breadboards for prototyping
 - A battery pack or a powerbank
 - The kaiborg studios protogen set
 - For the STM32F407G-DISC1, you must also have STM Studio. For the ESP32/Arduino boards, you must have Arduino IDE.
